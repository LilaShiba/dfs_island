# ðŸŒ´Island Problem: What is Optimal ðŸŒ´

*[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/)*<br><br>
Today, we are going to apply a recursive DFS to solve LeetCode's Island perimeter problem in [O(mn) worst case time complexity](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-videos/lecture-10-understanding-program-efficiency-part-1/). This question is a part of the July Challenge. A great extension is solving the problem iterativly. Feel free to jump ahead or act as a resource for your peers if this is too easy. I can always use the help teaching!

- Understanding the time complexity of a DFS : [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34816910/complexity-of-a-recursive-dfs) 

- Time complexity : O(MÃ—N) where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.

- Space complexity : O(min(M,N)) because in worst case where the grid is filled with lands, the size of queue can grow up to min(M,N)

Is this the best solution? What is optimal || what could be changed to make this more optimal?

##  ðŸŒ±Setting up the Helper Method ðŸŒ±

```txt
 loop through the matrix:
    if land:
        answer = self.helperFunction(para1, para2, para2...)
        return answer
return False
```

The idea here is we want to cycle through the matrix until we find a piece of the island and then run a dfs. I love setting up problems like this by using a helper function to solve/ acutallay do the computation. For example,

Take a few minuets to find out how you iterate over a matrix in Python. The answers are below. The idea isn't to bore you with a google search, but to get used to searching stackoverflow. I visit stackof about 3-5 times per day when working. We can't go in-depth here, but resources are linked.

## Where to Start -> Bounds of the Problem:
What is this problem actually asking? Meaning,

**Discussion**
- what do we want to count?
- how do we know what can be counted?
- how do we know when to end the program?

**Code-a-long OR code your own**<br>
> How does everyone feel about coding their own and then sharing answers?

**Create helper Function and Set Bounds**

            return 1
        # if 0 add 1
        # we are counting 0's not 1's b/c that's the perimeter

## Recurrance: DFS 
[recursion review via tracing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3U6LExgevE)<br>
When programming our [DFS](https://medium.com/basecs/deep-dive-through-a-graph-dfs-traversal-8177df5d0f13), we want to make sure that we

- continue searching until the whole island is searched
- don't revisit a node
- have a way of keeping track of island's perimeter
