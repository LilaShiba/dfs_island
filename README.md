# ðŸŒ´Island Problem: What is Optimal ðŸŒ´

*[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/)*<br>
Today, we are going to apply a recursive program to solve LeetCode's Island perimeter problem in [O(mn) worst case time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). This question is a part of the July Challenge. A great extension is solving the problem iterativly. Feel free to jump ahead or act as a resource for your peers if this is too easy. I can always use the help teaching!

##  ðŸŒ±Cycle Through Matrix ðŸŒ±

The idea here is we want to cycle through the matrix until we find a piece of the island and then run a dfs. I love setting up problems like this by using a helper function to solve/ acutallay do the computation. For example,

```txt
 loop through the matrix:
    if land:
        answer = self.helperFunction(para1, para2, para2...)
        return answer
return False
```


> What parameters should the helper function take in if using OOP?

Take a few minuets to find out how you iterate over a matrix in Python. The answers are below. The idea isn't to bore you with a google search, but to get used to searching stackoverflow. I visit stackof about 3-5 times per day when working. We can't go in-depth here, but resources are linked.

            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # calling our helper function
                # saving result of function in var p
                p = self.dfs(grid, i, j)
                    return p
    return 0 # if we go through the matrix without finding an island

## Where to Start -> Bounds of the Problem:
What is this problem actually asking? Meaning,

**Discussion**
- what do we want to count?
- how do we know what can be counted?
- how do we know when to end the program?

**Code-a-long OR code your own**<br>
> How does everyone feel about coding their own and then sharing answers?

**Create helper Function and Set Bounds**

```python
def dfs(self, grid, i, j):
        # out of bounds add 1
        if i < 0 or i > len(grid)-1 or j < 0 or j > len(grid[0])-1:
            return 1
        # if 0 add 1
        # we are counting 0's not 1's b/c that's the perimeter
        elif grid[i][j] == 0:
            return 1
        # if visited terminate search branch
        elif grid[i][j] == -1:
            return 0
        else:
            # recursive call(s) here
```

## Recurrance: DFS 
When programming our DFS, we want to make sure that we

- continue searching until the whole island is searched
- don't revisit a node
- have a way of keeping track of island's perimeter

             # mark location as visited
            grid[i][j] = -1
            down = self.dfs(grid, i+1,j)
            up = self.dfs(grid, i-1, j)
            right = self.dfs(grid, i, j+1)
            left = self.dfs(grid, i, j-1)
            return down + up + right + left
